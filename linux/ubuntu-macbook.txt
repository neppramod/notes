1. Internal audio does not work even with loading snd_hda_codec_cirrus
2. Also loaded btusb for bluetooth, seems little better with it

To load added following in /etc/modules-load.d/modules.conf

# Bluetooth usb module
btusb

# Sound module
snd-hda-codec-cirrus

sudo systemctl restart bluetooth.service 

Installed with: https://github.com/davidjo/snd_hda_macbookpro

git clone https://github.com/davidjo/snd_hda_macbookpro.git
cd snd_hda_macbookpro/
#run the following command as root or with sudo
./install.cirrus.driver.sh
reboot

After installation modules is compiled here: /usr/lib/modules/5.8.13-mbp/updates/snd-hda-codec-cirrus.ko



3. Check /var/log/boot.log for anything that is slowing boot

4. To load external device at boot, but not wait if it is not loaded (/etc/fstab)

UUID=<device_uuid> /media/sdcarddrv ext4 nofail,x-systemd.device-timeout=1ms 0 2


5. For touchpad

sudo apt install xserver-xorg-input-mtrack

/usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-mtrack.conf
