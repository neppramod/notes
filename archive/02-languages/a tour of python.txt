This document is intended as a hands-on introduction to Python's chief
features for someone with a passing familiarity with a contemporary object-
oriented programming language, such as C++, Java, or C#.  

Python's primary assets include

-.  its widespread adoption by the software community, as attested to by
    -.  its ranking at various 'mindshare' websites like www.tiobe.com, and
    -.  its use in enterprises like Google and the U.S. Dept. of Energy;
-.  its open-source license and extensive set of libraries, making it
    attractive for development on a tight budget;
-.  its support for multiple programming paradigms, including procedural,
    functional, and object-oriented programming, making it attractive
    for flexible development and teaching; and
-.  its interactive, command-line-based interpreter, which makes it attractive
    for students-- and developers-- who prefer more rapid feedback than the
    classic compile-review-re-edit development cycle affords.

This document is specific to Python 3.  Python 3, the current major release of
Python, eliminated various irregularities in the language while introducing
incompatibilities with Python 2.  One such change, the replacement of print
statements by a built-in print function, renders most logic in this document
incompatible with Python 2 and earlier versions.

This document is best viewed in an editor like Notepad++ that supports
widescreen text editing.  Its nine sections cover the following aspects of
the Python language:

-.  Obtaining Python.
-.  Running Python codes.
-.  Python values.
-.  Python control structures.
-.  Python functions.
-.  Python's functional language features.
-.  Python classes.
-.  OO programming in Python: design considerations.
-.  Concluding examples.

Section 2, running Python codes, is currently specific to the Windows
environment.  While the five strategies for running Python that this section
describes have equivalents in the Posix and Mac environments, these equivalents
are not discussed here.

Sections 3 through 9 intersperse discussions of Python's features with blocks 
of code that illustrate those features.  These blocks, which are surrounded by
comment lines that read
############# start of examples #############################################
and
#############  end of examples  #############################################
respectively, have been left-aligned in accordance with Python's use of
indentation for denoting block structure: a languistic feature that can 
either be regarded as

-.  a nuisance, in that needless or irregular indentation results in syntax
    errors, or
-.  a positive, in that this emphasis on regular indentation yields regular,
    more concise (i.e., begin-end-free) code.
    
They are designed to be cut and pasted into a Python interpreter.

This document, though lengthy, is not a complete introduction to Python's
feature set.  Notable omissions include

-.  constructs and idioms for creating, structuring, and accessing modules;
-.  most of the Python library catalogue; and
-.  metaprogramming in Python, including Python metaclasses.

For more on these and other topics, I recommend the following resources:

-.  Python's online documentation (cf. www.python.org), particularly
    -.  The library reference (http://docs.python.org/3/library/), which I
        consult routinely when writing Python code.  The following sections
        are ones that I've found to be particularly useful:
        -.  Section 2: builtin functions
            (http://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html)
        -.  Section 4: built-in types
            (http://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html)
        -.  Section 6.2: regular expressions
            (http://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html)
    -.  The language reference (http://docs.python.org/3/reference/), 
        particularly
        -.  Section 3, the Python data model, which features
            comprehensive documentation Python's special (__...__) attributes
            (http://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html).
        -.  Section 5.2, which documents the structure of Python's 
            modules (packages)
            (http://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html#packages)
        -.  Section 5.3, which documents Python's algorithm for searching
            modules for content, including how Python's cacheing strategy
            and sys.modules attribute affect module imports
            (http://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html#searching)
    -.  The Python usage document's section on configuring Python under Windows
        (http://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#configuring-python).
-.  Mark Lutz's _Learning Python_, 5th edition (O'Reilly), a massive 
    reference (1300+ pages) that covers Python 2 as well as Python 3.
-.  Mark Summerfield's _Python 3_ (Addison-Wesley), a faster-paced 
    reference that covers much of Python in about 600 pp.

1.  Obtaining Python.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Begin by downloading and installing the latest stable release of Python.  You
can get it from http://www.python.org/download/.  As of this writing,

-.  the current stable release was 3.3.4.
-.  the link to various implementations of this release, including
    implementations for Posix, Microsoft, and Mac platforms, was
    http://www.python.org/download/releases/3.3.4/
-.  the link to the Windows-64bit precompiled release was
    http://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.3.4/python-3.3.4.amd64.msi

Install Python to the default install directory.  For Python 3.3 under Windows,
this is C:\Python33


+++++++++++++++++++++++++++
2.  Running Python codes.
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This section presents five ways in which Python can be invoked from the Windows
environment.

1.  As an interactive command line interpreter.

    From the Windows program startup menu,

    -.  Locate the Python 3.3 folder.
    -.  In the folder, locate Python (command line)
    -.  Double click on this icon.
        You should see a window entitled "C:\Python33\python.exe"
    -.  Enter the command    1+2    , followed by a return
    -.  Enter the command    exit   , then follow directions.

    Note:  Python uses indentation to delimit blocks.  As a rule, enter all
    commands flush left, unless block structure requires otherwise.

2.-3.  From the Python interactive environment, in two ways.

    2.  From the Windows program startup menu.

    -.  Locate the Python 3.3. folder
    -.  In the folder, locate IDLE (Python GUI)
    -.  Double click on this icon.  This should open a window entitled
        "Python 3.3.2 Shell".  Depending on IDLE's current state, this window
        might be opened as a minimized window, requiring activation from the
        Windows Taskbar.
    -.  Enter the command   1+2     , followed by a return

    3.  From the IDLE environment proper.

    -.  Open a new edit window, in either of two ways:
        -.  by selecting File\New Window
        -.  by entering Control-N.
        Either should open window entitled *Untitled*
    -.  Enter 1+2 into this window
    -.  Run this code, in one of two ways
        -.  by selecting Run\Run Module
        -.  by typing the F5 key
        IDLE will require you to save this code to a file before running it.
        For this demo, save the code as C:\temp\temp.py
    -.  You should see the result in the window entitled "Python 3.3.2 Shell"

    Finish by closing both windows.

4.-5.  From the command line, in two ways.

   4.  Interactively.

       -.  Raise a Windows command prompt window.
           -.  Note:  you can do this by entering   cmd     into the textbox
               in the Windows startup menu.
       -.  Ensure that the Python home directory is in the command prompt
           window's command path.
           -.  To check if this directory is on the command path,
               -.  Enter the Windows command   set
               -.  Examine the output for the line that starts  Path=
               -.  If this output-- the Path environment variable's string--
                   lacks a reference to the Python installation directory--
                   here, assumed to be C:\Python33\ --
                   -.  Execute the command
                           set Path=%Path%;C:\Python33
                       Important:  do *not* leave spaces around the =
                   -.  Enter the command   set    to confirm that Path now
                       includes  C:\Python33
               Note: the procedure described here affects only the current cmd
               window.  To include (say) C:\Python33\ in every cmd window's
               initial path string, use the Windows control panel's "Advanced
               Settings" option to update Path's default value.
           -.  Enter the command
                    python
               You should now see the Python command prompt.
           -.  Enter  1+2     , followed by a return
           -.  Enter  Control-Z    to exit the interactive session.

   5.  As a command-line command.

       -.  Raise a command window whose Path environment variable references
           Python's installation directory, as described above.
       -.  Open a file named (say) C:\temp\temp.py in a text editor.
       -.  Edit this file so that it contains one line that reads    print(1+2)
           Position this line flush left in the file.
       -.  From the command prompt, enter the command
                python  c:\temp\temp.py

           Note:  print(1+2) is needed instead of 1+2 because the interactive
           Python intepreter implicitly redirects the output of top-level
           "expression statements" like 1+2 to the user's console.  In non-
           interactive contexts, printout must be requested explicitly.

3.  Python values.
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

----------------------------------------------
*.  Illustrating Python support for arithmetic
----------------------------------------------

    Python supports integer, floating point, and complex numbers.
    Python-supported numeric operators include  addition (+), subtraction (-),
    division (/), integer division (//), remainder (%), exponentiation (**),
    bitwise negation (~), bitwise and (&), bitwise or (|),
    bitwise exclusive or (^), bit shift left (<<), and bit shift right (>>).

    Try entering the following:

############# start of examples #############################################

7//3
7%3
7*3
7**3
7>>1
7<<1

7j**2    # a complex value

# import statements create references to entities in the Python environment.
# range iterators yield a sequence of numbers.
# the "for" statement below consumes those numbers.
# all be covered in more detail later.
#
from math import log10, ceil
for i in range(0, 10000, 100):  print(i, ceil(log10(2**i)), 2**i)

#############  end of examples  #############################################

-.  Illustrating Python support for logical operations.

    Python supports logical and, or, and not, as well as the relational
    operators < (less than), <= (less than or equal), == (equal),
    != (not equal), >= (greater than or equal), and > (greater than).

    As with C, its implementation language, Python treats 0 as False and other
    atomic values as True.  Python also treats empty collections as False
    and non-empty collections as True.

    Try entering the following:

############# start of examples #############################################

# *** ***  illustrating Python's C-like notion of truth  *** ***

'[]  is treated as ' + 'true' if []  else 'false'
'[1] is treated as ' + 'true' if [1] else 'false'

# **** ***  illustrating Python's support for cascading relational operators  *** ***

4 < 5 < 6
4 < 6 < 5
4 < 6 < 8 > 7 > 5

# **** ***  illustrating floating point imprecision and its management *** ****
#
# idea:
# -.  value_1 captures a series of integer values
# -.  value_2 captures an "equivalent" series or values, generated with floating point math
# -.  as a rule, value_1 != value_2, due to floating point imprecision
# -.  value_2, however, should be "reasonably close" to value_2:
#     i.e., within a factor of epsilon, the smallest distinguishable value between floating point values,
#           scaled by the magnitude of value_1 and value_2

import sys
from math import ceil, log10

print('comparing two sequences of supposedly equal values, generated by integer and floating point arithmetic, respectively')

low, high, delta = 1000000, 1000099, 0.1

seed_value_2 = delta * low - delta

# Note Python's use of indentation-- rather than paired delimiters like {,} or begin,end-- 
# to recognize the start and end of the "for" loop's block.
# 
# Throughout these codes I follow the Ruby convention for block indentation,
# indenting each block by two spaces from the block that contains it.
#
# Other notes:
# -.   \ at the end of a long line allows for that line's continuation onto the next.
# -.  Python's interpreter uses a single, totally empty line to mark the end of a top-level block.
#
for value_1 in range (low, high):
  seed_value_2 += delta
  value_2 = seed_value_2 / delta
  #
  abs_1, abs_2 = abs(value_1), abs(value_2)
  #
  exact_comparison = value_1 == value_2
  approximate_comparison_tolerance =\
    sys.float_info.epsilon * (1 if min(abs_1, abs_2) == 0 else 10 ** ceil(1 + log10(min(abs_1, abs_2))))
  approximate_comparison = abs(value_2 - value_1) <= approximate_comparison_tolerance
  #
  print( 'values 1 and 2 are {0} and {1}'.format(value_1, value_2) )
  print( 'exact comparison yields {0}; approximate comparison (tolerance: {1}) yields {2}'.\
            format('==' if exact_comparison else '!=', approximate_comparison_tolerance, '==' if approximate_comparison else '!=') )

#############  end of examples  #############################################


----------------------------------------------------------
*.  Illustrating Python help conventions (dir, docstrings)
----------------------------------------------------------

    The following codes illustrate two common mechanisms for creating self-
    describing Python objects.

    The first, the dir() method, when invoked on a Python object, returns a
    list of that object's attributes, including any references to methods and
    data that it contains.  

    The second, a docstring, is a string that's associated with a Python
    object's '__doc__' attribute.  By convention, docstrings describe the
    purpose and use of their associated objects.  They may also specify test
    cases for those objects' methods, in ways that support those methods'
    automated testing, via Python library test routines.

    The following codes show a use of dir() statements and docstrings to
    discover the characteristics of Python library objects:  something I often
    do during interactive Python coding sessions.

############# start of examples #############################################

# dir(), when invoked without an argument, returns identifiers in the current environment.
# dir(), at interpreter level, shows identifiers at global scope.
#
if not 'math' in dir():  import math    # make sure 'math' has been imported

dir(math)              # show the routines in the math module, 
print(math.__doc__)    # along with the math module's docstring

# show the docstrings of various methods and values from the previous example.
#
# below, eval(name + '.__doc__') recover the named object's docstring.
# The expression 'eval(..expr..)' interprets the string '..expr..' in the
# current environment, returning the result of this interpretation.
#
for name in ['eval', 'log10', 'ceil', 'range', 'sys.float_info', 'abs']:
  print( eval(name + '.__doc__') + '\n-----\n')

#############  end of examples  #############################################

    By convention, identifiers like __dir__ and __doc__ whose names start
    and end with double underscores are reserved for "special" attributes:
    attributes that 

    -.  Python language contructs associate with Python statements, or
    -.  Python library modules associate with certain methods or content

    Here, for example,

    -.  the builtin Python dir() function evaluates 'dir(m)'
        as a call to 'm.__dir__()', while
    -.  Python's doctest library module searches the contents of an object's
        __doc__ attribute for test cases.

    These special attributes provide developers with "hooks" for customizing
    the operation of Python objects to a particular application's needs.

    
-------------------------------------------------
*.  Illustrating Python built-in data structures
-------------------------------------------------

    In addition to integers and floating point values, Python supports six
    types of native data structures:

    -.  strings
    -.  lists
    -.  dicts
    -.  tuples
    -.  sets
    -.  frozensets

#  This last example fails because of Python's requirement that keys for dicts be *immutable*
#  (i.e., unchangeable, constant) values.  This requirement is imposed for efficiency's sake.
#
#  Python, for efficiency, uses hashing on a dict's key to find a key's associated value.
#  Immutability assures that a given value's hash stays fixed over a dict's lifetime.
#
#  Lists, as shown above, are mutable (i.e., updateable).
#      [Note:  this is the reason that list.__hash__.__doc__ is undocumented:  Python treats lists as unhashable.]
#  Lists, accordingly, cannot be used as keys for dicts.
#
#  What can be used, instead, is a list-like Python datatype known as a *tuple*.
#  Tuples, like lists, are sequences of values, including (nested) sequences.
#  Unlike lists, tuples are immutable, and can only contain immutable values.

4.  Python control structures
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Basic Python control structures can be divided into three groups:

-.  "self-contained" simple statements:                   "pass", "=" (assignment), "del", "import", "assert", and "raise"
-.  compound statements:                                  "if", "while", "for", and "try"
-.  simple statements that support compound statements:   "break" and "continue"
-.  simple statements that qualify scoping:               "global" and "nonlocal"

The "global" and "nonlocal" statements will be presented later, in the section
on function definition.


------------------------
*.  Simple statements
------------------------

    Pass, the simplest of Python's simplest statements, takes no operands and
    does nothing.  It's used primarily as a placeholder, in compound statements
    and functions that should be included for clarity, but that do nothing.


----------------------------
*.  Assignment statements
----------------------------

    A Python assignment statement updates the value associatd with a Python
    identifier.  Python identifiers consist of

    -.  an initial letter or underscore, followed by
    -.  an arbitrary number of letters, numbers, and underscores.

    Case is significant:  AA, aa, Aa, and aA are different identifiers.

    Assignment statements function differently, depending on whether the
    assignment involves
    -.  immutable or mutable source objects;
    -.  referencing, copying, or deepcopying;
    -.  direct or incremental updating of the target object; and
    -.  individual or multiple target identifiers

#############  end of examples  #############################################


----------------------------------------------------------------------
*.  Other simple statements: "del", "import", "assert", and "raise"
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    "del", the inverse of assignment, removes identifiers from the Python
    environment.

    "import" imports references to objects in supporting modules into the
    current environment, making the referents available for program use.

    "assert", under ordinary interpreter operation, raises an exception if its
    first operand evaluates to False.  This behavior can be disabled by
    invoking the interpreter with the "optimize" (-O) flag.

    "raise" raises the specified exception.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*.  Compound statements:  "if", "for", "while", "try";  "break" and "continue"
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Python's "if', "for", "while", and "try" statements are similar to their
    counterparts in other programming languages.  Key differences are as follows:

    -.  Python uses whitespace to delimit a compound statement's constituent
        blocks, as follows:

        -.  All statements that are subordinate to a clause in a compound
            statement-- e.g., an "if" statement's "if" and "else" blocks--
            must be indented, relative to their "master" clause.

        -.  All statements that are at the same level in a compound statement
            must have the same initial indentation string.  This second
            requirement can be a nuisance when working with an editor that
            automatically converts tabs to spaces, since Python's "tab nanny"
            treats tabs and spaces as different characters.

        -.  Top-level function and class definitions (see below) must be
            followed by a totally blank line:  i.e., one that contains no
            characters, not even whitespace.  Python's interactive interpreter
            also enforces this requirement for top-level compound statements,
            which is why compound statements in this document are followed by
            blank lines.

    -.  Python's "if" statement, following its "if" clause, supports

        -.  an optional, Modula-like, optional sequence of "elif...elif...elif"
            clauses, followed by

        -.  an optional, final "else" clause.

    -.  Python "for" statements can iterate over sequences of arbitrary values.
        "for" statements are not restricted to integers, as in (say) C.  These
        sequences of values are produced by a kind of state-maintaining function
        called an iterator.  Iterators

        -.  use "yield", rather than "return", to return succesive values
        -.  pick up where left off when invoked from a "for" clause, rather
            than restarting "from scratch"
        -.  execute "return" statements or raise StopIteration exceptions to
            gracefully bring an iteration to a close

    -.  Python "for" and "while" statements have optional "else" clauses, which
        execute once, on normal loop termination.  Using "break" to exit a loop
        bypasses its "else" clause, if present.

    -.  Python "try" blocks that include exception-handling (i.e., "except")
        clauses can be followed by an optional "else" clause.  This clause is
        executed if the body of the "try" clause completes successfully.

    -.  Python "try" blocks can be followed by an optional "finally" clause,
        which always executes after the "try" clause executes, along with any
        of the statement's (optional) "except" and "else" clauses.

5.  Python functions
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Python can be thought of as supporting three kinds of functions:
-.  library functions
-.  user-defined named functions, like show_object_docstrings()
-.  user-defined nameless functions, known as lambda expressions


-------------------------------
*.  Python library functions
--------------------------------

    Python's standard library of functions can be divided into two groups:
    -.  one group of built-in functions, which are loaded by default into
        the Python environment on Python startup
    -.  one group of library functions like math.ceil and math.log10 that must
        be expressly imported into a user's session to be accessed.

-.  Built-in library functions.

    Examples of Python built-ins from previous examples include print(),
    len(), range(), and dir().  The following shows further examples
    of built-ins.

############# start of examples #############################################

# *** *** built-ins for managing sequences:  sorted(), reversed(), zip() *** ***

x = [3, 1, 4, 2]
sorted(x)
reversed(sorted(x))
[i for i in reversed(sorted(x))]
sorted(x, reverse=True)

y = ['three', 'one', 'four', 'two']

zip(x, y)
[v for v in zip(x, y)]


# *** *** built-ins for interpreting strings as code:  eval(), exec()  *** ***

# *** eval: evaluates a single expression, returning a single value ***

eval('3 + 4')

x = 3
eval('x + 4')

eval('x = 3 + 4')   # fails: eval requires expressions, and this is an assignment statement

# *** exec: evaluates a statement block, returning None ***

exec('x = 7; print(x)')
x


# *** *** shows all built-ins *** ***
#
# see http://docs.python.org/3/library/ for additional documentation

import builtins
show_object_docstrings(builtins)       # this is how I learned about sorted()'s reverse keyword

#############  end of examples  #############################################


-.  Other library functions

    The official documentation for the Python 3 standard library
    (see http://docs.python.org/3/library/) devotes 28 sections to the non-
    builtin parts of Python's library.  These sections feature logic for

    -.  text processing, including regular expressions
    -.  binary data processing
    -.  auxiliary data types, including temporal types, arrays, and queues
    -.  numeric types, including decimal values, fractions, and random values
    -.  functional programming
    -.  file and directory access
    -.  data persistence
    -.  data compression and archiving
    -.  file formats
    -.  cryptography
    -.  operating system services
    -.  concurrent execution, including threading
    -.  interprocess communication and networking
    -.  Internet data handling, including e-mail
    -.  markup processing, including html and xml
    -.  Internet protocols
    -.  multimedia
    -.  internationalization
    -.  program frameworks, including Turtle graphics
    -.  GUI interfaces
    -.  development tools, including doctest
    -.  debugging and profiling
    -.  Python runtime services, including sys and futures
    -.  custom Python interpreters
    -.  Python module importation
    -.  language manipulation
    -.  generic output formatting
    -.  Microsoft-, Unix-, and other-platform-specific modules

    The next example shows functions from Python's file system access module.

----------------------------------
*.  User-defined named functions
----------------------------------

    Functions, as shown earlier, are defined using Python's def statement.
    "def" is an executable statement that updates Python's environment.  The
    following statements apply to Python functions:

    -.  Their names must be valid Python identifiers.
    -.  They may be defined with arbitrarily many arguments.
    -.  They must contain at least one statement.
    -.  They may reply to their callers in either of two ways:
        -.  They may return values.  Functions that return values do not
            preserve state between calls.
        -.  They may yield values.  Functions that yield values, known as
            *iterators*, preserve the state of their local data between calls,
            resuming execution at the statement following the last yield.
        By default, a function that "falls off the end" without executing
        a return or a (final) yield is deemed to return the value 'None'.

    Examples of iterators were shown earlier, in connection with "for"
    statements.  The following examples highlight "ordinary", value-returning
    functions.

------------------------------------------------------------
*.  Function definitions, environment, and scoping rules
------------------------------------------------------------

    Python's def statement dynamically alters Python's execution environment:
    i.e., the set of lists that Python searches to determine the values of
    identifiers in the expressions it executes.

    A def statement only affects Python's environment if it successfully
    completes execution.  A def with a malformed header clause or body-- one
    that won't parse or violates one of Python's rules for well-formedness--
    has no effect:  it simply leaves the environment unchanged.

    To understand exactly how a successful def statement affects the Python
    environment, it helps to understand how Python's environment is structured.

    I think of the Python environment as an object that contains
    -.  a master list of all identifiers that are defined for statements that
        are
        -.  positioned outside of all function and class definitions:
        i.e., at the interpreter's global scope.

    -.  each of the function and class objects in this master list, in its
        turn, contains a master list of identifiers that are defined for
        statements that are
        -.  positioned inside that function or class, but
        -.  outside of all other functions or classes that this object
            might contain;
        i.e., at a scope depth of 1.

    -.  each of the functions and class objects in these scope-level-1 lists,
        in its turn, contains a master list of identifiers that are defined for
        statements that are
        -.  positioned inside that function or class, but
        -.  outside of all other functions or classes that this object
            might contain;
        i.e., at a scope depth of 2.

    This nesting of "code container" objects within "code container" objects--
    e.g.,

    -.  functions within the outermost Python interpreter
    -.  functions within functions within the outermost Python interpreter
    -.  functions with classes within the outermost Python interpreter
    -.  functions within functions within classes within the outermost Python
        interpreter
    -.  functions within functions within classes within classes within the
        outermost Python interpreter

    can be continued indefinitely.  The resulting nesting of code containers
    can yield a nesting of definitions that's similar to the nesting common
    to common, lexically scoped languages like Pascal, C, C++, Java, and C#.

    One difference between Python and these other languages is that Python
    "while", "for", "try", and "if" statements don't open new scopes, as is
    true in (say) C.   Within any given Python module, only def and class
    statements create new scopes.

    A second difference is due to Python's lack of mandatory declarations.
    In most statically scoped 3GL's, the scope to which a nonlocal identifier
    x belongs is determined by looking "upward and outward" from a use of x,
    until a declaration for x is encountered.

    Since Python, by default, doesn't support variable declarations, this
    "upward and outward" strategy can't be used to disambiguate references.
    What Python uses, instead, is a set of rules that, as I understand them,
    work as follows:

    *.  Python essentially supports three scopes:
        -.  global scope, the scope of the top-level interpreter
        -.  local scope, the scope of current def or class declaration
        -.  nonlocal scope, the scope of any identifiers that lie "above"
            the current def or class declaration but "below" global scope.

    *.  Python allows you to declare identifiers as global or nonlocal.  Python
        has no "local" declaration:  variables that are determined to be local
        are done so, by default, in ways that make an initial assignment to a
        variable local, by default.

    *.  The rules for identifier scoping, as I understand them, are as follows:

        -.  All identifiers defined at Python's global scope are global.
            -.  global declarations are ignored at the global level, while
            -.  nonlocal declarations are treated as erroneous

        -.  Any identifier may be the subject of at most one of three
            declarations at the top level of any function or class:

            -.  a global declaration
            -.  a nonlocal declaration
            -.  a formal parameter declaration

            Any definition that contains two or more of these declarations
            for the same identifier at the top level of a given function or
            class is malformed.

        -.  For an identifier x that is named at most by one declaration,
            the following decision process determines x's scope:
            -.  is x is named in a global declaration?
                 -.  yes:  x is treated as a global (top-scope) value.
                 -.  no:   is x named in a nonlocal declaration?
                     -.    yes:  x is treated as a nonlocal value.
                     -.    no:  is x named as a formal function parameter?
                           -.    yes:  x is treated as a local value that, if bound to a mutable,
                                       references a value defined elsewhere
                           -.    no:   is x read before being updated in the current scope?
                                 -.    yes:  x is read from the closest enclosing scope
                                 -.    no:   x is treated as a local value

    The following examples illustrate these rules.

*.  Varargs and keyword arguments
----------------------------------

    Python doesn't support overloading in the C++/ Java/ C# sense of the term.
    If you create a second definition a function f in a given scope, the
    second definition overwrites the first.  Functions, however, can be made
    to accept varying numbers of values-- a common goal of overloading--
    using keywords and varargs.

    The following examples illustrate this point.

*.  lambda expressions
--------------------------

    A lambda expression-- so named because its originator, mathematician Alonzo
    Church-- used the Greek letter "l" as a shorthand for "let"-- is a nameless
    function that consists of

    -.  the keyword "lambda", followed by
    -.  a list of the function's arguments, followed by
    -.  the function's body:  a single expression

    Lambdas were supported in one of the first widely used higher level
    programming languages, the functional programming language Lisp.
    Lambdas have been a staple of functional programming languages for decades.
    More recently, lambdas have been incorporated into a "mainstream"
    programming language, LINQ.

6.  Python's functional programming features
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

-------------------------------------------------------------
*.  About functional (i.e., sequence-oriented) programming
-------------------------------------------------------------

Functional programming, loosely speaking, is computation with operators that
-.  take sequences as inputs, returning
-.  new sequences or values as outputs

Functional programming typically also includes functionals:  functions that
-.  takes functions as inputs, returning
-.  (related) functions as outputs

Functional programming's chief virtue is the concision afforded by the use of
sequence-based operators and functions in place of explicit loops.  The
resulting, shorter codes make logic easier to write, read, and maintain.

Earlier examples have highlighted four functional programming constructs:
-.  slicing - i.e., the use of [x:y:z] style syntax to subset sequences
-.  list comprehensions - i.e., the use of [... for ... in ....]
    to construct lists
-.  filters - i.e., the use of "if ..." clauses in comprehensions to limit
    a comprehension's content
-.  lambdas - i.e., nameless functions

A fourth useful construct, reduction, is highlighted below.  Reduction is
analogous to database aggregation, but with a parameterized aggregation operator.
Python's reduction function-- actually, a functional-- takes three arguments:

-.  a function that
    -.  accepts two arguments:
        -.  a value that represents an intermediate result
        -.  a value that represents the next value in a sequence to reduce
    -.  returns the result of continuing the reduction, using these two inputs
-.  a sequence to reduce
-.  an initial value, for priming the intermediate result.
    This initial value is typically the identify element for the
    operation that's driving the reduction.

Reductions can also be conceptualized in terms of accumulator loops, which they
typically replace.  Intuitively,

-.  the function's first parameter corresponds to an accumulator variable
-.  the function's second parameter corresponds to the loop's index variable
-.  the initial value corresponds to the accumulator variable's initial
    value, set outside the loop.

7.  Python classes
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

------------------
*.  Introduction
------------------

    A Python class can be regarded as a **unique** **container** whose
    **content** **can be used** to **generate** a **family** of **objects**:

    -.  **unique**.  Each Python class has an identity that differentiates it
        from all other objects in a Python environment.

    -.  **container**.  A Python class is structured as a list of references
        to values.  These references are commonly referred to as a class's
        **attributes**.

    -.  **content**.  A class's attributes are said to belong to that class,
        in the sense that a Python associates a class's name with these
        attributes.

    -.  **can be used**.  Some Python statements and operators invoke certain
        "special" attributes with well-known names to accomplish class-related 
        actions.  For example,

        -.  Python's dir() built-in invokes a class's __dir__ attribute to 
            list that class's attributes.
        -.  Python's id() built-in invokes class's __hash__ attribute
            to retrieve that class's unique identifier.

    -.  **generate**.  Two of a class's special attributes, __new__ and 
        __init__, are invoked by Python's constructor construct to create
        and initialize a new object.

    -.  **family**.  Python treats a class as a type.  All objects that are
        are generated from that class initially have that class as their type.
        (Note: the word *initially* is used here because a Python code can,
         subject to certain restrictions, dynamically change an object's type.)

    -.  **object**.  An object, according to Page-Jones, is an entity that
        has the following five characteristics:

        -.  an *identity*:
               a value that distinguishes this object from other objects in
               the Python environment
        -.  a *state*:
               a collection of (subordinate) objects that are associated
               with (i.e., "internal to") that object and that can vary
               over the course of a computation
        -.  an *interface*:
               a set of identifiers that reference the object's contents.
               this includes *methods*:  actions that are associated with that
               object that can access and possibly update an object's state
        -.  a set of *behaviors*:
               actions that affect itself and its environment,
               as implemented by its methods.
        -.  a *lifetime*:
               a duration in an overall computation during which the
               object exists.

        In addition to these five characteristics, Python objects, as noted
        above, are typed.

    In addition to these qualities, Python classes are also subclassed.  Every
    Python class is a subclass of at least one other class:  possibly, of two
    or many.  Ultimately, all classes are descended from class object, the
    class at the top of the Python class hierarchy.  As in other object-
    oriented (OO) languages, saying that a Python class B is a subclass of a
    Python class A means that class B can potentially *inherit* A's content:
    i.e., access and manipulate A's content directly, as if that content were
    part of B's explicit definition.

    The following examples illustrate these basic principles of Python classes.

*.  Instance methods, staticmethods, and classmethods
--------------------------------------------------------

    When a class constructs an instance of itself, it associates that instance
    with a directory of references that Python statements and operators use to
    accomplish instance-related actions.  These references can be divided into
    two kinds of references:

    -.  references to shared entities.  All instances of a class share the code
        objects that correspond to the methods that a class defines.  All
        instances of a class also share data items that are local to the class
        definition.

    -.  references to entities that are specific to the instance.  Every 
        instance of a class is initialized with a reference to a set of 
        references that are exclusive to that class instance.  By convention, 
        that reference to an instance's private data is called "self".

    The methods that a class contains can be divided into three basic categories,
    according to the objects that they access.

    -.  instance methods.   An **instance method** is one that can access self:
        i.e., the data associated with a **specific** instance of a class.

    -.  staticmethods.  A **staticmethod** is limited to accessing references
        to a class's shared entities:  i.e., entities associated with the class
        proper.  Staticmethods are commonly used to manage a class hierarchy's
        shared instance data:  i.e., data that is essentially hosted by the 
        hierarchy as a whole, rather than any one class in the hierarchy.

    -.  classmethods.  A **classmethod** is essentially a staticmethod that
        also has access to the contents of the class that instantiated its
        associated object.  Classmethods are commonly used to manage content
        that is specific to a class:  i.e., data that is essentially hosted by
        a specific class, rather than an inheritance hierarchy as a whole.

    The distinction between staticmethods and classmethods is subtle, and,
    from what I can tell, probably immaterial for most applications.  I show
    it here, however, for completeness.

    Instance methods, staticmethods, and classmethods are defined in 
    different ways:

    -.  Instance methods include a special first parameter, typically called
        self, that references the instance's private data.  All instance data
        should be stored in and accessed from self.

    -.  Staticmethods are defined without this special first parameter.
        A method intended for use as a staticmethod, however, must be wrapped
        in special logic that preprocesses its inputs.  This is done by setting
        the desired staticmethod name to the output of a built-in Python 
        functional, staticmethod(), that does the wrapping.

    -.  Classmethods are defined with a different special first parameter:
        the object of the class that instantiated the current instance.
        A method intended for use as a classmethod must also be wrapped
        in special logic that preprocesses its inputs.  This is done by setting
        the desired classmethod name to the output of a built-in Python 
        functional, classmethod(), that does the wrapping.

    The examples that follow illustrate Python protocols for invoking instance
    methods, staticmethods, and classmethods as well as the differences between 
    these types of methods.

*.  Data initialization, @staticmethod and @classmethod decorators
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    In the previous example, calling one of MyClass's show methods before
    calling its corresponding set method will result in an AttributeError
    exception, caused by an attempt to access an attribute that has not
    yet been defined.  These "use before define" errors can be prevented
    by initializing class and instance attributes when the class and its
    instances are first created.

    Python provides different mechanisms for initializing class and instance
    attributes.  Python supports the use of assignment statements in of class
    definitions to initialize static and class values.  Python's default
    object constructor, __init__, is the standard Python mechanism for 
    initializing instance data.

    Python also supports a shortcut for defining static and classmethods.
    This shortcut involves the use of a second kind of functional, known as a
    **decorator**, for wrapping static and classmethods.  A decorator is a 
    construct of the form

      @something
      ... definition of object foo ...

    that acts as a shorthand for

      .... definition of object foo ...
      foo = something(foo)

-----------------------------------------

    The examples included showed how to call methods that a class contains from
    outside of that class's scope.  In order to call a method from inside the

*.  Superclass-subclass interaction:  exploiting and avoiding virtualization
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In an OO language, the following sequence of actions creates a situation
    where the language's run-time system must choose between two methods with
    the same name:

    -.  an object obj_A of type class_A invokes a method m_1 defined in 
        one of A's superclasses, superclass_A
    -.  superA method m_1, in turn, invokes a second method m_2 that has
        two definitions:
        -.  a first in superclass_A, superclass_A.m_2
        -.  a second in class_A, class_A.m_2

    If the language, when confronted with this choice, chooses class_A.m_2
    over superclass_A.m_2, method m_2 is said to be *virtual*.  The term,
    "virtual", is (to me) an unfortunate and confusing name for a policy that
    "simply" says, 
       "when an ambiguity arises with regard to choosing between two methods
        with a common name, favor the original object's point of view 
        over the superclass's."

    Treating methods as virtual by default is regarded as a best practice in
    OO language design.  In Python, virtualization is a natural consequence of
    the use of "self" to qualify method names.  To avoid virtualization, invoke
    an instance method with an explicit reference to its container class.

*.  Superclass-subclass interaction:  multiple inheritance
----------------------------------------------------------------

    Python supports **multiple inheritance**: the ability of a class to acquire
    attributes from two or more superclasses.  One common use of multiple 
    inheritance involves the creation of *mixins*:  classes that contain logic
    -- typically, complex logic -- that could potentially find use in two or
    more client classes.  Mixins support a "once-and-only-once" approach to 
    logic design: a key strategy for enhancing a code's maintainability.

    To specify that a class inherits from two or more classes, list that
    class's superclasses in its header, in order of priority.  Classes that
    appear to the left in list take priority over classes that appear to the
    right in case of name conflicts (if any) involving superclass attributes.

    A class's primary superclass is recorded in that class's __class__.__base__
    attribute.  The classes from which a class inherits can be identified by
    invoking *any* (!) class's __class__.mro() method (short for "method
    resolution order") with the class of interest as its argument.  Similarly, 
    a class's subclasses can be identified by invoking *any* (!) class's 
    __class__.__subclasses__() method on the class of interest.

*.  Shorthands for managing instance data:  properties
---------------------------------------------------------

    The property() functional, a Python builtin, allows an identifier to serve
    as a stand-in for a combination of a getter, a setter, a deleter, and/or
    a docstring setter.  This method can be invoked in one of three ways:

    -.  As a function with keywords.  A call like
            foo = property(fget=get_foo, fset=set_foo, fdel=del_foo, fdoc=foo_docstring)
          in an instance x of a class allows client codes to use expressions like
            -.  print(x.foo)  in lieu of  print(x.get_foo())
            -.  x.foo = 3     in lieu of  x.set_foo(3)
            -.  del x.foo     in lieu of  x.del_foo()
          and  x.foo.__doc__ as a synonym for docstring.
        Note that the keyword version of this idiom allows for the definition
        of a property that lacks any of these four methods.
        
    -.  As a function with positional parameters.  Calls to
        -.  foo = property(get_foo)
        -.  foo = property(get_foo, set_foo)
        -.  foo = property(get_foo, set_foo, del_foo)
        -.  foo = property(get_foo, set_foo, del_foo, foo_docstring)
        define foo as a property with a get method; with get and set methods;
        with get, set, and del methods; and with get, set, and del methods and
        the foo_docstring docstring, respectively.  To define a property that
        lacks one or more of these methods, that parameter can be passed as
        "None":  e.g.,
        -.  foo = property(get_foo, None, None, foo_docstring)
            defines a read-only property with a docstring.

     -.  Using property decorators.  Here,
         -.  an initial decorator, @property, is used to specify that a function
             -- say, foo-- foo is a getter for a property named foo:
                @property
                def foo(self):
                    """ a docstring for foo, if one is wanted, goes here """                
                    ....
         -.  subsequent decorators with the property name prepended to the 
             decorator are then used to specify the property's setter and/or
             deleter, if required.  The functions being decorated must also
             have the property's name:  e.g.,
                @foo.setter
                def foo(self, value):
                    ....
                @foo.deleter(self):
                    ....

       When defining a property, use a name for that property that differs from
       the names of all of a class's instance variables.  Using the same name
       for a property and an instance variable "confuses" the Python 
       interpreter:  attempting to access such a name causes Python to repeatedly
       access the name as a property rather than the name as an attribute of
       self, leading ultimately to stack overflow and a program crash.

*.  Superclass-subclass interaction:  accessing "shadowed" methods
----------------------------------------------------------------------

    When a method in a class C "shadows" a method m of the same name in one of
    that class's superclasses SuperC, the superclass method of the same name 
    can be invoked in one of two ways:

    -.   using the syntax super().m( .... ), where "..." is short for the
         method's remaining parameters, **provided that** SuperC is the 
         first class in object.__class__.mro(C)[1:] with a method m
         
    -.   using the syntax SuperC.m( self, ... ), where "..." is short for the
         method's remaining parameters, when the more flexible "super()" can't
         be used:  e.g., in multiple inheritance hierarchies with multiple
         superclasses with __init__ methods

    This need to call a superclass method with the same name as a subclass
    method arises commonly for class constructors, where it is used to delegate
    the work of initializing attributes defined in superclasses to the 
    superclasses that define them.

--------------------------------------------------------------
*.  Customizing relational operators: in particular, __eq__
--------------------------------------------------------------

    Each of Python's relational operators implements its comparison by invoking
    a special attribute associated with its left-hand operand:

    -.  <  invokes __lt__
    -.  <= invokes __le__
    -.  == invokes __eq__
    -.  != invokes __ne__
    -.  >= invokes __ge__
    -.  >  invokes __gt__

    These operations can be tailored to a class's semantics by redefining them
    in a class's definition.  Python requires these attributes to be defined as
    functions of two arguments:

    -.  self,  the current object's state
    -.  other, the state of the object with which to compare the current
        object: i.e., the relational operator's right-hand operand.

    Ordering comparisons between objects are not always appropriate.  By
    convention, a comparison between incomparable objects should return
    NotImplemented.  Python converts NotImplemented to False in the absence of
    a special check for NotImplemented.

    Every user-defined class **should** be assessed to determine appropriate
    definitions for __eq__ and __ne__.  This is of particular concern for 
    immediate subclasses of object, since object.__eq__ and __ne__ use id() 
    to test for equality:  i.e.,
    
         object_a == object_b    iff   
             object_a and object_b reference the same (memory) object

    Using id() to test for equality is inappropriate when objects should be 
    compared by behavior rather than identity.  One common strategy for 
    crafting behavior-centric definitions is to check for equal type and 
    state:  i.e.,
    
         object_a == object_b  iff  
              object_a and object_b are of a common type and
              object_a and object_b have the same state

    One surprising implementation wrinkle is that Python apparently tests
    for a == b by checking *both* objects' __eq__ attributes:  i.e.,

        a == b iff  a.__eq__(b) and b.__eq__(a)

    This policy, which differentiates Python from (e.g.) Ruby, which omits
    the "right to left" check, assures the symmetry of ==.  It does not, 
    however, ensure that __eq__ is transitive:  see below for examples.

8.  OO Programming in Python:  Design Considerations
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

-----------------
*.  Data hiding
-----------------

    Like other OO languages, Python supports encapsulation.  An object B that
    is contained in an object A must, by default, be referenced "through" A, 
    using expressions like A.B.  While it is possible to make an external 
    module's contents directly visible to another module, this also requires
    a "reaching through" the external module's "exterior", using syntax like

      from external_module import entity
    
    Unlike most OO languages with which I'm familiar-- and this includes C++,
    C#, Java, Eiffel, and Ruby-- Python does not support data hiding as a
    language feature.  Python lacks the equivalent of declarations like 
    "public", "private" and "protected", which are common to other OO
    languages.  With the exception of a few built-in immutable classes and
    constants, all Python identifers are readable and updateable, as are the
    objects they reference.  I've seen this lack of checking justified on the
    grounds of efficiency and flexibility:  i.e.,

    -.  Enforcing data hiding in the absence of static typechecking would
        impose a significant overhead on every data access, most of which
        would involve useless checks.
    -.  Programmers should have the freedom to break data hiding whenever
        the dictates of a problem warrants this.
        
    Python, however, does support one weak mechanism for data hiding, as well
    as a second, somewhat stronger mechanism for protecting attributes against
    access.  The weak mechanism, name mangling, is invoked automatically for
    attributes whose names start with a double underscore.  Python manages 
    these attributes by "silently"

    -.  assigning them new names and
    -.  converting all references to these attributes from within their
        container objects to these new names

    This transforming of those attributes' "real" names effectively invalidates
    all external references to the "real" names.  This transformation, however,
    is easily circumvented, as shown in the examples below.

    The other approach to name mangling involves redefining __getattribute__
    and __setattr__, special attributes for retrieving and updating an object's
    attributes.  With a few exceptions involving special attributes like 
    __hash__, access to an object's attributes can be controlled by recoding
    the following special attributes:

    -.  __getattribute__, which dereferences identifiers in contexts where
        where their values are being read
    -.  __setattr__, which dereferences identifiers in contexts where their
        values are being updated

    However, as shown below, techniques similar to those required for this
    recoding can be used to bypass the recoded __getattribute__ and
    __setattr__.

    The __getattribute__ and __setattr__ attributes can also be recoded so as
    to respond to requests for attributes that the class does not explicitly
    define.  This "trick" is comparable the use of Ruby's :methodNotImplemented
    method to respond to undefined method calls: an idiom that the Ruby 
    community refers to-- somewhat confusingly-- as "virtual methods".

*.  Dependency inversion
--------------------------

    The term "dependency inversion" dates to a time when objects supplanted
    procedures as the primary basis for software design.  The term refers to
    the structuring of a family of modules that serve the same essential 
    function as codes with a common interface.  This "interchangeable parts"
    approach to program design was developed as an alternative to "run-time
    type inference" (RTTI):  a design strategy that
    
    -.  treats related modules that have different preconditions for operation
        as different  entities, and
    -.  selects which module to call at run-time via a series of tests that
        assess the current execution context.

    RTTI is now in disfavor, since it hinders program evolution. In RTTI-based
    designs, adding modules to or removing modules from a given family of 
    modules can force changes to *all* codes that access *any* of these 
    modules.  Dependency inversion, by contrast, localizes such changes to 
    the modules proper, so long as those modules' common interfaces can be 
    kept contstant.
    
    The first two examples below show the use of RTTI and dependency inversion,
    respectively, to implement a query-driven program action.  The second 
    example's implementation simulates the standard idiom for dependency 
    inversion in strongly typed languages like C++, C#, and Java:

    -.  The example treats all binary query objects as subclasses of a common,
        "binary response" base class.
    -.  The example uses this "binary response" class to verify that its
        "get_time" method has been supplied with a binary query object:
        a type check that "classic' languages do at compile-time instead.
        
    Using a base class to represent a family of related objects is a standard
    practice in languages with compile-time typing.  Algorithms for compile-
    time type checking, as a rule, require the type of every identifier to
    be declared explicitly and held fixed.  These representative base classes,
    as a rule, are constructed as **abstract** base classes:  classes that 
    can be subclassed but cannot be used to instantiate objects directly.  In
    keeping with this practice, the example's base class has been defined as an
    instance of a Python library module, ABCMeta, that prevents a class C from
    instantiating new objects of type C.

    Python's native type-checking algorithm is far looser than C++'s, C#'s, or
    Java's.  Python's lack of mandatory type declarations, together with its
    support for "on-the-fly" code generation via eval() and exec(), make
    compile-time typing problematic at best and impossible at worst.  Python,
    rather, implements a form of run-time type checking, which assesses 
    whether the statements it executes and the objects that appear in those
    statements reference 

    -.  attributes that can be read and/or written, according to the sense of
        the contexts in which they appear, and, in the case of objects,
    -.  possess the well-known attributes, like __dir__ (for calls to dir())
        and __call__ (for calls to identifiers) that these contexts require.

    This approach to typing is referred to as "latent typing" or "duck typing",
    as in, "if it walks like a duck and talks like a duck, it's a duck".
    This approach to typing is favored by a minimalist school of software
    design, including authorities like Russ Olsen (_Eloquent Ruby_) who argue
    for achieving software quality by writing
    -.  concise programs with clearly named variables
    -.  that are supported by carefully crafted regression test suites.

    Authorities on dynamically typed languages like Olsen routinely criticize
    hard-coded type checks as constructs that clutter programs:  i.e., that
    attempt to address problems that would be better addressed by careful
    attention to naming and regression testing.  While they encourage the use
    of inheritance for eliminating duplicate code, they see it as useless
    for supporting the defining of types.

    As someone who sees value in type checking, I'm not sure if I agree with
    this "minimalist" position.  Still, I've included a third, Olsen-style
    implementation of the second example as a basis for comparison.  Note that
    the code in this third example fails to catch the error created by the use
    of a method name, queryOption, to designate a method that returns four 
    possible values instead of just two.

    In addition to supporting a mechanism for defining abstract base classes,
    the Python library also provides decorators that cause a class's methods
    and properties to be treated as abstract methods and properties:  i.e.,
    objects that the class's subclasses are required to overload.  See Section
    28.7 of the Python Library Document, the section on Python's abc
    ("abstract base class") module, for details.


-------------------
*.  Docstrings
-------------------

    A docstring is a string that's referenced by an object's __doc__ attribute.
    By convention, docstrings document an object's purpose and provide test 
    cases for that object's execution.  The Python interpreter automatically
    binds a string literal that appears as the first statement of a function or
    class to that object's __doc__ attribute.

    Docstrings have a special significance for the Python library's doctest
    module, which
    -.  searches docstrings for substrings that are formatted as docstring-
        like test sessions, then
    -.  executes those commands to confirm that they return the specified
        results and/or have the desired effects.

    The examples below use a doctest module function, run_docstring_examples,
    to invoke doctest() on a single function.  The Python library manual's
    documentation on doctest gives further examples that show how to run 
    doctest on entire modules-- i.e., .py files-- from the command line as 
    well as from Python codes:  a mode of use that the manual says is much
    more common in practice.

*.  Serialization
------------------

    Serialization is the saving of an object's state in a way that allows that
    object to be reinitialized at a later time.  Some common reasons for
    persisting objects include

    -.  The desire to dispatch part of a computation to another host,
        in order to use parallelism to make that computation run faster.
    -.  The desire to examine a computation's intermediate states, in order to
        -.  verify that program's correctness or
        -.  debug that program's execution
    -.  The desire to allow a computation to be restarted in the event of
        system failure:  a particular concern for computations that can take
        days to finish.
    -.  The desire to use the output of a first computation as the input to a
        second.

    Various third-party packages have been developed for serializing Python
    object content in relational databases.  These packages are commonly
    to as object-relational mappers, or ORMs for short.  The most widely used
    and well known ORM for Python is probably SQLAlchemy (www.sqlalchemy.org).  
    SQL Alchemy supports a variety of popular back-end databases, including 
    MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite.  Its website includes extensive how-to
    documentation, including (e.g.) code for saving recursive objects in
    a back-end database.

    The Python distribution proper provides two lighter-weight mechanisms for
    serializing object content.  The one, pickling, is supported by the Python
    library's pickle module.  Pickling, which converts an object's state into
    a byte stream, is described in detail in the Python library.

    While ORMs and pickling seem useful, the only serialization mechanism that
    I've worked with to date is Python's repr() builtin.  Python classes, by
    convention, often include a special method, __repr__, that outputs a
    class instance's content in a way that allows that instance to be 
    recreated, using eval().  One advantage of repr() methods for debugging is
    is they dump an object's contents in text, which makes a program's state
    easier to review.
    
    Serialization has its limitations, in that some types of Python objects
    resist serialization.  Opaque data types like code, for example, can neither 
    be effectively pickled nor repr-ized, as shown below.  These limitations,
    however, are not ones that I've had to work around in my Python coding--
    at least, not to date.

# *** *** showing the repr-ization of a class instance and the subsequent
# *** *** reconstruction of an equivalent class instance
#
# Key points:
#
# -. The class is defined in a way that localizes all variable data that 
#    a class instance depends on to that instance.  The class, for example,
#    does not define class-scope data that varies over time.  None of the
#    class's methods, moreover, reference global variables whose state must
#    be saved to reconstruct the instance's execution context.
#
# -. The class is defined with an __init__ method that exposes all of its
#    internal state, in the sense of allowing a constructor to initialize
#    all internal data directly.  Doing so allows for the definition of a
#    __repr__ method that outputs a constructor expression.
#
# -. The class's __repr__ method uses the :r qualifier to reprize the
#    individual components of the class's state.  This idiom is common
#    for repr methods.
#
# -. The class's __eq__ method has been defined to test for equivalence 
#    based on equal state.  This definition is essential for using == 
#    to validate the definition of __repr__, as shown below

class MyClass:
  def __init__(self, iv_1, iv_2):  self.iv_1, self.iv_2 = iv_1, iv_2
  #
  def __repr__(self):  return "{0}({1!r},{2!r})".format(self.__class__.__name__, self.iv_1, self.iv_2)
  #
  def __eq__(self, other):  return isinstance(other, MyClass) and self.iv_1 == other.iv_1 and self.iv_2 == other.iv_2
  def __ne__(self, other):  return not(self.__eq__(other))

x = MyClass([1, 2], {'three':3})

repr(x)   # showing how a repr-ized instance looks

eval(repr(x)) == x     # must evaluate to True if __repr__ has been defined correctly


#  illustrating the point that code objects resist repr-ization
#
f = lambda: 3
g = lambda: 3
repr(f)
repr(g)   # f and g are functionally equivalent, but have different repr's
f == g    # they are not, moreover, equal under Python's definition of equality

y = MyClass(1, f)
z = MyClass(1, g)
repr(y)
repr(z)    # similarly, y and z are equivalent, but have different repr's
y == z     # they also fail to test as equal

eval(repr(y))   # fails, because repr(f) isn't a valid Python expression

    including functions within functions, as shown earlier, and classes
    within classes, as shown below.  In this example, the Card class is nested

*.  Iterators
-----------------

    A class's __iter__ method determines the sequence of values that a class
    instance returns when it's included in a loop.  
    
    One of two standard idioms for using __iter__ is to define __iter__ as a
    self-contained generator for returning the desired sequence.  The other,
    more common idiom treats __iter__ as an initializer for a second special
    attribute, __next__.  In this second idiom, 
    
    -.  __iter__ is defined as a two-part method that
        -.  initializes any state that's needed to support the iteration, then
        -.  returns self, as a way of handing off the computation to __next__.
    -.  __next__ then uses this internal state to return each element of
        the required sequence in succession

9.  Modules
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

--------------------
*.  Introduction
--------------------

    Previous exercises have shown the use of Python's import statement to augment the current 
    Python environment with references to objects defined in the Python standard library.  So
    far, two variants of the import command have been shown:
    
    -.   import m1          # imports module m1, enabling use of references to objects m1 exports, 
                            #    using syntax like m1.foo
                            # also supports the importation of multiple modules:  e.g.,  import m1, m2, m3
    -.   from m1 import o1  # imports object o1 from m1, enabling use of references to o1
                            # also supports the importation of multiple objects:  e.g.,  from m1 import o1, o2, o3
                              
    Python supports two further variants of the import command:
                                  
    -.   from m1 import o1 as a1    # imports object o1 from m1, enabling referencing of o1 under the alias a1
    -.   from m1 import *           # imports all objects that m1 exports

    The first of these two variants should be self-explanatory.  The second will be covered in more detail below, 
    in the course of discussing the following concepts:

    -.  changing the interpreter's import path
    -.  managing the Python import cache
    -.  managing name conflicts with the Python standard library
    -.  mechanisms for supporting command-line-based module execution, including
        -.  __name__ == '__main__'
        -.  sys.argv
        -.  sys.stdout, sys.stderr, exit()
        -.  sys.stdin
    -.  using __all__ to specify module exports
    -.  creating **packages**:  i.e., modules that share a common directory with an __init__.py file
    
    
--------------------------------------------
*.  Changing Python's default import path 
--------------------------------------------

    The Python interpreter supports two types of modules: built-ins, which are compiled into Python, and file-based
    modules, which are accessed via the interpreter's resident file system.  A file-based module foo will be found
    in a file named "foo.py", in a directory specified by Python's sys.path identifier.  This sys.path identifier
    lists directories to search when importing modules in order of precedence, much as 
    
    -.  a standard CLI's PATH variable names directories to search for executables and
    -.  Java's CLASSPATH variable names directories to search for Java class libraries.
    
    By updating sys.path, you can change how Python resolves the first attempt to import a given module.

import sys
print sys.path

>>> identify two directories that are currently missing from the list of directories in the list sys.mypath
>>> for the sake of this example, we'll assume these directories are subdirectores of your current directory,
named mydir1 and mydir2.

>>> continue by creating two files:
>>>>>> a first, mydir1/foo.py, that contains one function, as follows:

def foo():  print("Hello - I'm foo, version 1")

>>>>>> a second, mydir2/foo.py, that contains one function, as follows:

def foo():  print("Hello - I'm foo, version 2")


>>> next, run the following command.  It should fail.

import foo


>>> next, run the following commands:

sys.path += ['mydir1', 'mydir2']
sys.path
import foo
foo.foo()

>>> next, **while keeping this Python session open**, change the content of mydir1/foo.py to read

def foo():  print("Hello - I'm foo, updated version 1")

>>> then run the following commands in the Python session

import foo
foo.foo()

>>> finally, **while keeping this Python session open**, run the following commands

sys.path = sys.path[:-2] + ['mydir2', 'mydir1']
sys.path
foo.foo()  # this still produces unexpected results for reasons explained below  

#############  end of examples  #############################################


---------------------------------------------------------
*.  Managing Python's protocols for module importation
---------------------------------------------------------

    The last two executions of foo.foo() in the previous series of examples produce unexpected 
    results because of Python's implementation of the import statement.  When Python first 
    imports a module 'foo', it uses sys.path to locate 'foo'.  Upon locating foo, Python caches 
    two of foo's attributes in sys.modules:

    -.  the name of the module being imported, in a key in sys.modules
    -.  the location of the imported module, in the key's corresponding value

    Subsequent attempts to reimport 'foo' then
    -.  either have no effect, if foo is present in the session, or
    -.  reference the module location recorded in sys.modules, independently of sys.path,
        otherwise.
        
    This cacheing of an imported module's attributes speeds the process of importing new modules
    when those modules, in turn, reference previously imported modules-- a considerable time 
    savings in the case of commonly referenced modules.  Cacheing, however, creates a need to
    circumvent caching when revising a module over the course of a given session.

    The following example shows two strategies for circumventing cacheing:
    -.  the imp.reload() function, which works when reimporting a module whose source file's 
        path remains constant
    -.  manipulating sys.modules, which is needed when reimporting a module whose source file's
        path has changed

#############  end of examples  #############################################

---------------------------------------------------------------
*.  Managing name conflicts with the Python standard library
---------------------------------------------------------------

    Start a new Python session, and run a command like
    
       for i in sys.modules.items():  print(i)
    
    to see a list of modules that Python pre-loads when it begins execution.  If, for some obscure
    or misguided reason, you try to import a module with one of these names, Python will ignore the
    attempt to import that module, much as it ignored the attempt to access foo from mydir2 in the
    first set of exercises above.  If, for some obscure or misguided reason, you really want to import
    a module named (say) 'errno', 'os', or 'io', you can do so by first deleting the relevant key-value
    pair from sys.modules before importing your module.   I would, however, strongly advise against
    reusing any of the names assigned to these standard Python modules.
    

---------------------------------------------------------
*.  Making Python's modules aware of execution context
---------------------------------------------------------

    A Python module can be run as a program if that module is supplied as the first argument to 
    the Python interpreter.  In addition to enabling command-line-interpreter- (CLI-) based module 
    execution, Python provides features that allow a module to do the following:
    
    -.  determine whether it's been invoked from a command line
    -.  for CLI-based executions,
        -.  access the command line arguments with which it was called
        -.  return output to the session window, via sys.stdout or sys.stderr
        -.  accept input from a session window, via sys.stdin
        -.  return a result code to the CLI environment

    print(this)

-------------------------------------------------------------
*.  Accessing command-line arguments and execution context
-------------------------------------------------------------

    Python's sys module includes objects that act as references to resources in standard POSIX 
    environments.  They include
    -.  sys.argv - 
            the command line arguments that a command interpreter (CLI) passes to a program 
            when it begins execution
    -.  sys.stdin, sys.stdout, sys.stderr - 
            a program's standard input, output, and error streams, respectively
            
    The Python standard library also supports access to an executable's environment variables.
    This facility, however, is provided through the os library module variable os.environ.
    
            
#############  start of examples  #############################################

>>> Begin this series of examples by saving the following code to a file-- say, bar.py.  
>>> This code also illustrates a use of Python's regular expression module--here, to check
>>> for strings that can be parsed as integers.
           
import sys, re

for (argno, arg) in enumerate(sys.argv):
    if not(re.match('[+-]?\d+$',arg)):  
        print('arg {0} ({1}) is not of type int'.format(argno, arg), file=sys.stderr)

print("sum of integer arguments in argv is {0}".format(sum([int(i) for i in sys.argv if re.match('[+-]?\d+$',i)])))


>>>  then, try executing it with command lines like the following:

    python bar.py 1 a 2 b 3 c
    python bar.py 1 a 2 b 3 c 1> nul     # use 1> /dev/null from a Unix environment;  "nul" is windows
    python bar.py 1 a 2 b 3 c 2> nul     # use 1> /dev/null from a Unix environment;  "nul" is windows

*.  Packages
--------------------------------------------------

    A package, roughly speaking, is 
    -.  a set of modules in a common directory, together with
    -.  (a possibly empty) file, __init.py__, that
        -.  is executed when the module is loaded, and
        -.  appears to be useful for three purposes:
            -.  updating the application's runtime environment
            -.  making modules available to the "from module import *" statement,
                using the __all__ variable
            -.  adding object names to the current scope, using import statements 

    The two hedges in that description are deliberate:
    -.  The phrase "roughly speaking" is used because a package's designer can use a package
        attribute named __path__ to extend a package's scope to multiple directories.  As the 
        Python tutorial notes, however, this use of __path__ is infrequent.
    -.  The phrase "appears to be useful" is used because of the lack of good documentation
        on how __init__ can be used to initialize a module's codes.  After a fair amount of
        experimentation, I've discovered the following:
        -.  The __all__ feature works as described (e.g.) in Summerfield
        -.  __init__ is useful for relieving callers of the need to do a series of imports:
            e.g., for making a function available from a package module under a package-
            author-determined name.
        -.  __init__ appears to be useful for initializing other objects in a package's scope.
            Modules in the package, however, must explicitly import the names of those objects
            in order to access them.  This includes names of other package modules.
        -.  If there's a way of using __init__ to update global variables, I haven't found it.
