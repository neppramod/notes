Having used ecb for a few year now, the only commands I ever use are:

    Jump to the directory window CTRL-c . gd (ie type ctrl and c together, release and press '.', release and press 'g' then 'd')
    Jump to the history window CTRL-c . gh
    Jump to the last window you were in CTRL-c . gl
    Jump to the first editor window CTRL-c . g1

The directory browser can be controlled without using the mouse too – just use the arrow keys and enter – give it a go!dd




Keyboard navigation:

ECB windows from bottom to top.

    Go to history: "C-c . g h"
    Go to methods: "C-c . g m"
    Go to sources: "C-c . g s"
    Go to directories: "C-c . g d"

Main buffer: "C-c . g 1"
