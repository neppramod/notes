MyApp Developement
* Difference in Event and Donation
*** Person does not have reference to donation, only donation has reference to person.
*** TODO Add route.
*** TODO Not done rake db:migrate
*** TODO Restart to see the changes. Can get some error message for db:migrate 
    (wonder if it is even required for mongo)

*** Errors
    1. Undefined local variable or method `description' for Donation:Class while accessing index
       Could be variable defined in index or model.
       a. Check model first (Y)
       b. If not, check index second.

       Since a happened, check index and all other places where description is not used.
       Before that check whether description is a field of Donation (Y).
       - Added in index.html, edit.html, new.html, show.html
	
       - We also need to permit it in donations_controller (Y)

       - Check localhost:3000/donations again.

   2. undefined method `filed' for Donation:Class
      - Misspelled in Donation model (Y, for description)
      
      - Check localhost:3000/donations again.
      - Created donation.

* Check mongodb database for donation
  Purpose: To check whether person object is attached to donation or not.

* Check edit
  *** Works ***
* Check delete
  *** Works ***

* Backup and Try to Change the data type of fields.
  - Git and in archive.
  - Check Mongoid reference document to find out supported data type.
  - Research how date is represented in rails (datepicker like in Roo ?)
